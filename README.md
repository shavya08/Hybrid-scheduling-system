# Hybrid-scheduling-system
Developing a hybrid scheduling system for Warwick Business School using Python

Case Description 

Introduction
Hybrid scheduling becomes relevant after COVID-19 pandemic. Moallemi and Patange (2023)
propose a hybrid scheduling system which has been implemented at Columbia Business
School. This group project will be based on the mentioned paper and you are asked to work
on the following tasks.

Moallemi, C. and Patange, U., 2023. Hybrid Scheduling with Mixed-Integer Programming at
Columbia Business School. INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics, Articles in Advance, pp.1-
19.

Tasks
1. (30%) Describe in your own words the student-level scheduling optimization problem formulation discussed in Section Student-Level Scheduling: Formulation and Appendix A.1, including decision variables, constraints, the objective function, and all required parameters. State any necessary assumptions.

2. (30%) You are asked to consult the MSBA programme team at WBS on a potential hybrid timetable scheduling for a single term under the assumption that everything is scheduled in person, i.e., wbs.live is changed to 0.004. Use the information in two data files provided and collect additional information if needed, prepare the data and implement the student-level scheduling optimisation problem in Python, focusing only on MSBA students and six main modules. Explain in detail the assumptions and data structures that you use and any important implementation issues.

3. (40%) Solve the problem using Python and analyse different solutions by varying relevant parameters and comment on how the proposed formulation can be improved or implemented differently (if possible)?
